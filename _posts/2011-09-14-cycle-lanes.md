================

A cycle lane is a traffic lane marked on an existing roadway or carriageway and generally restricted to cycle traffic. (from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_lane))

In OSM you can add cycle lane information to any road type, e.g.

{% highlight ini %}
highway = residential
cycleway = lane
{% endhighlight %}

The OpenCycleMap guide to tagging
=================================

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) is a wonderful project, and it's where OpenCycleMap gets almost all of its data from. However, one of the very fundamental things - that you can tag anything, any way you like, is also a bit intimidating.

This guide aims to explain how to go about tagging things that are relevant to cyclists. Not every detail can or ever will show up on OpenCycleMap, but instead will be used by other projects that also use OSM data.

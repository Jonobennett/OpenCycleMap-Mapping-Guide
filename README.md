This is just an experiment. It might work, it might not.

The aim of the project is to replace in entirity the woefully unloved "Tagging
Guide (for OSM Contributors)" at
http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/shine/cycle-info/ with something a bit more
user-friendly, while maintaining editorial control and not descending into
mayhem. I'm looking at you, wiki.openstreetmap.org :-) . I take inspiration from
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/

# Contributing

It's really easy to contribute, and I welcome your proposals!

## Quick changes

If you are viewing this on github.com, just find the file you want to change
(likely in the _posts folder) and find the button that says "Edit this file".
Make your changes, and they'll be submitted for review

## In-depth

The project is based on the [jekyll markdown
engine](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Clone the repository, install
jekyll, and run

    jekyll --server --auto

for best results. There's a whole load of jekyll that I don't know yet, so feel
free to enlighten me.
